## Prerequisites

To build from source, you need to have a Go version that is between 1.14.x through 1.17.x. Go 1.18.x and above include a libp2p version that is not currently supported.

## Design

Powergate is composed of different modules which can be used independently, and compose together to provide other higher-level modules.

Here's a high-level overview of the main components, and how Powergate interacts with IPFS and a Filecoin client:
![Powergate Design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6136245/86490337-6dbd5200-bd3d-11ea-9895-3689dd1c8a8f.png)

Note in the diagram that the Lotus and Filecoin client node _doesn't need_ to be in the same host where Powergate is running. They can, but isn't necessary.

### 📢 Deals module
The Deals module provides a lower layer of abstraction to a Filecoin client node. It provides simple APIs to store, watch, and retrieve data in the Filecoin network. Currently, it interacts with the Lotus client but we have plans to support other Filecoin clients.

### 👷 Indices and Reputation scoring
Powergate builds three indexes related to on-chain and off-chain data.

The _Miners index_ provides processed data regarding registered miners (on-chain and off-chain), such as: total miner power, relative power, online status, geolocation, and more!

The _Ask index_ provides a fast-retrieval up to date snapshot of miner's asking prices for data storage.

The _Faults index_ provides history data about miners faults while proving their storage on-chain. 

Built on top of the previous indexes, a _Reputation_ module constructs a weighted-scoring system that allows to sort miners considering multiple on-chain and off-chain data, such as: compared price to the median of the market, low storage-fault history, power on network, and external sources (soon!).

###  ⚡ FFS
This module provides a multitiered file storage API built on Filecoin and IPFS. Storing data on IPFS and Filecoin is as easy as expressing your desired configuration for storing a Cid.

### 💫 API + CLI

Powergate exposes an API built from the various modules through gRPC endpoints. 
You can explore our [`.proto` files](https://github.com/textileio/powergate/tree/master/proto/powergate) to generate your clients, or take advange of a ready-to-use Powergate Go and [JS client](https://github.com/textileio/js-powergate-client). 🙌

We have a CLI that supports most of Powergate features.

To build and install the CLI, run:
```bash
$ make install-pow
```
The binary will be placed automatically in `$GOPATH/bin`. You may have to set the Path variables using the below commands
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
$ export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
```
You can then run `pow` in your terminal.

You can read the [generated CLI docs](https://github.com/textileio/powergate/blob/master/cli-docs/pow/pow.md) in this repo, or run `pow` with the `--help` flag to see the available commands:

```
$ pow --help
A client for storage and retreival of powergate data

Usage:
  pow [flags]
  pow [command]

Available Commands:
  admin        Provides admin commands
  config       Provides commands to interact with cid storage configs
  data         Provides commands to interact with general data APIs
  deals        Provides commands to view Filecoin deal information
  help         Help about any command
  id           Returns the user id
  storage-jobs Provides commands to query for storage jobs in various states
  version      Display version information for pow and the connected server

Use "pow [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Installation

Powergate installation involves running external dependencies, and wiring them correctly with Powergate.

### External dependencies
Powergate needs external dependencies in order to provide full functionality, in particular a synced Filecoin client and a IPFS node.

#### Filecoin client
Currently, we support the Lotus Filecoin client but we plan to support other clients.

All described modules of Powergate need to comunicate with Lotus to build indices data, and provide storing and retrieving features in FFS. To install Lotus refer to its [official](https://lotu.sh/) documentation, taking special attention to [its dependencies](https://docs.lotu.sh/en+install-lotus-ubuntu). 

Fully syncing a Lotus node can take time, so be sure to check you're fully synced doing `./lotus sync status`.

We also automatically generate a public Docker image targeting the `master` branch of Lotus. This image is a pristine version of Lotus, with a sidecar reverse proxy to provide external access to the containerized API. For more information, refer to [textileio/lotus-build](https://github.com/textileio/lotus-build) and its [Dockerhub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/textile/lotus).

In short, a fully-synced Lotus node should be available with its API (`127.0.0.1:1234`, by default) port accessible to Powergate.

### IPFS node
A running IPFS node is needed if you plan to use the FFS module.

If that's the case, you can refer [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/) for installation instructions, or its [Dockerhub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs) if you want to run a contanerized version. Currently we're supporting v0.5.1. The API endpoint should be accessible to Powergate (port 5001, by default). 

Since FFS _HotStorage_ is pinning Cids in the IPFS node, Powergate should be the only party controlling the pinset of the node. Other systems can share the same IPFS node if can  **guarantee** not unpinning Cids pinned by Powergate FFS instances. 

### Geolite database
Powergate needs an offline geo-location database to resolve miners country using their IP address. The same folder in which `powd` is executing, should have the Geolite2 database file `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` or you can pass the `--maxminddbfolder` flag to `powd` to specify the path of the folder containing `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`.
You can copy this file from the GitHub repo at `iplocation/maxmind/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`. If you run Powergate using Docker, this database is bundeled in the image so isn't necessary to have extra considerations.

### Server
To build and install the Powergate server, run:
```bash
make install-powd
```
You can run the `-h` flag to see the configurable flags:
```bash
$ powd -h

```

## Localnet mode

Having a fully synced Lotus node can take a considerable amount of time and effort to mantain. We have built [lotus-devnet](https://github.com/textileio/lotus-devnet) which runs a local network with a _sectorbuilder_ mock. This provides a fast way to spinup a local network where the sealing process if mocked, but the rest of the node logic is the same as production The _localnet_ supports both 2Kib and 512Kib sectors, and the speed of block production is configurable. Refer to [lotus-devnet](https://github.com/textileio/lotus-devnet) readme for more information.

If you're interested in running Powergate and experiment with the CLI, the fastest way is to replace the Lotus client dependency with a running localnet, which runs a local Lotus client connected to a network with local miners. 

A simple docker-compose setup is available that will run Powergate connected to a Lotus local network with 512Mib sectors and allows to use the gRPC API or CLI without any extra config flags! 🎊  Note: you will first need to [install Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in order to get started.
```bash
cd docker
make localnet
```
This will build Powergate `powd`, a Lotus local network with `BIGSECTORS=true` by default, an IPFS node and wire them correctly to be ready to use.

**Note**: Running `BIGSECTORS=false make localnet` will create the Lotus devent using 2Kib sectors. This may be more appropriate for certain development or testing scenarios. 

Here is a full example of using the local network:
Terminal 1:
```bash
cd docker
make localnet
```


Wait for seeing logs about the height of the chain increase in a regular cadence.

Terminal 2 (in the top-level repo directory):
```bash
make build
❯ head -c 700 </dev/urandom > myfile
❯ pow admin user create
{
  "user":  {
    "id":  "c06382e0-2021-4234-be53-6e07a8d40065",
    "token":  "883f57b1-4e66-47f8-b291-7cf8b10f6370"
  }
}
❯ pow data stage -t 883f57b1-4e66-47f8-b291-7cf8b10f6370 myfile
{
  "cid":  "QmQJxVtp61Y7UrdjUKuWvse3TxGHaPDyA7RobrBhFwqcBM"
}
❯ pow config apply -w -t 883f57b1-4e66-47f8-b291-7cf8b10f6370 QmYaAK8SSsKJsJdtahCbUe7MZzQdkPBybFCcQJJ3dKZpfm
{
  "jobId":  "b4110048-5367-4ae5-8508-709bf7969748"
}
                 JOB ID                |       STATUS       | MINER  |  PRICE   |    DEAL STATUS     
---------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+----------+--------------------
  b4110048-5367-4ae5-8508-709bf7969748 | JOB_STATUS_SUCCESS |        |          |                    
                                       |                    | f01000 | 62500000 | StorageDealActive
❯ pow data get -t 883f57b1-4e66-47f8-b291-7cf8b10f6370 QmYaAK8SSsKJsJdtahCbUe7MZzQdkPBybFCcQJJ3dKZpfm myfile2
> Success! Data written to myfile2
```

In this example we created a random 700 bytes file for the test, but since the localnet supports 512Mib sectors you can store store bigger files.

## Production setup

A production setup is also provided in the `docker` folder. It launches `powd` connected to `lotus` and `ipfs`, plus a set of monitoring components:
- _Prometheus_, which is the backend for metrics processing.
- _Grafana_, for metrics dashboard.
- _cAdvisor_, for container metrics.
- _Lotus_, node running on the current mainnet.
- _IPFS_, node running to back Powergate FFS.
- _Powergate_, wired with all of above components.

Depending on which network you want to connect to, you have to run different commands:
- `make up`, to connect to `mainnet`.

Remember that you should wait for _Lotus_ to be fully-synced which might take a long time; you can check your current node sync status running `lotus sync status` inside the Lotus container. We also provide automatically generated Dockerhub images of Powergate server, see [textile/powergate](https://hub.docker.com/r/textile/powergate).

If you're interested in a more detailed explanation about Powergate installation, please refer to the [installation docs](docs/manual_installation.md).

## Tests
We have a big set of tests for covering most important Powergate features.

For integration tests, we leverage our `textileio/lotus-devnet` configured with 2Kib sectors to provide fast iteration and CI runs.

If you want to run tests locally:
```bash
make test
```
It will auto-download any necessary dependencies and run all tests.

## Benchmark
There's a dedicated binary to run benchmarks against a Powergate server. For more information see the [specific README](cmd/powbench/README.md). 

Soon we'll add benchmark results against real miners in mainnet, so stay tuned. ⌛
